![January Half Marathon](../images/theHM_group.JPG)

In October 2020 I decided to do a 10-week training plan for a half marathon. Of course, there are no half marathons right now, but on January 30th, 2021, I ran a half marathon, on a course I designed, with the help of several friends from the Providence Community Ultimate Team. Turns out January 30th was a terribly cold day, so that wasn't great, but everything else about the run was a blast.
